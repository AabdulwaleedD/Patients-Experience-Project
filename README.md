# Hospital Patient Experience Dashboard

A 3-page interactive Excel dashboard built to analyze and visualize patient satisfaction, operational efficiency, and experience metrics from hospital survey and visit data (Jan–Dec 2025).

## 📊 Project Overview

This dashboard transforms raw patient and operational data into actionable insights for hospital leadership, operations, and quality teams.

### Pages Included

1. **Executive Overview**  
   High-level KPIs, visit volumes by department/visit/appointment type, monthly trends via sparklines.

2. **Operations & Efficiency**  
   Deep dive into waiting times: monthly trends, walk-in vs scheduled comparison, medication availability %, median vs average analysis.

3. **Patients Experience & Ratings**  
   Overall satisfaction (% ≥4), category averages, radar chart for department balance, ratings by visit type, cleanliness & clarity breakdowns.

## Key Findings from the Data

- **Waiting times remain high** — Average 74.79 min across all departments (every one >70 min), with a noticeable summer peak (~76 min in July/August).
- **Walk-ins wait significantly longer** than scheduled patients — consistent gap in every department.
- **Clarity of Information is critically low** — Only 1.99/5 (4.75% ≥4) — biggest patient pain point.
- **Doctor Communication is weak** — 2.84/5 (19.15% ≥4), shows slight negative correlation with longer waits in some departments.
- **Facility Cleanliness is a strength** — 3.99/5 (79.80% ≥4) — clear standout area.
- **Medication availability** — ~80–83% Yes across departments (lowest in Pharmacy & Surgery).

## Features & Tools Used

- Excel Tables + structured references
- PivotTables & PivotCharts
- Slicers for filtering (Month, Department, Visit Type, Appointment Type)
- Helper columns for % ≥4 satisfaction
- Radar chart, clustered bars, horizontal bars, sparklines
- Conditional formatting (heatmaps, red for low scores)
- Calculated fields (overall avg rating)
- Insights boxes on every page

## Lessons Learned & Takeaways

- Data cleaning takes longer than visualization — always start there.
- Excel Tables + structured references prevent a lot of headaches.
- PivotCharts + connected slicers give near-Power-BI interactivity for free.
- Writing "KEY INSIGHTS" on every page forces real business value.
- One focused visual (radar, scatter with trendline) beats many cluttered ones.

## Future Improvements

- Add benchmark lines (e.g., target wait <60 min)
- Include correlation scatter (wait vs communication) with R²
- Power Query for advanced cleaning & refresh
- Conditional formatting on more KPIs
